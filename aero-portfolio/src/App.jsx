                      <p>
                        I am an artist at heart.  When I'm not coding, I'm usually working on illustrated books.
                        Digital art is where my love for tech intersects with drawing.  Lately, I've been using
                        Blender and Krita for that.  A fun fact about me is that I do all my creative work on Linux.
                        I've installed Arch Linux on all of my devices at home and I am a firm believer that you can
                        use any operating system for art with enough imagination.  In addition to using open source
                        software, I'm also a contributer to various open source projects.  More on that in the
                        "Personal Projects" section.
                      </p>

                            <p>When I first joined Northwestern Mutual, email templates had to be manually written by 
                              engineers in order to meet compliance and brand guidelines.  In my spare time, I began
                              working on a prototype for an app that could generate an email that met all required
                              guidelines (specific to the recipient) with copy from a Word document.  The app initially
                              used SvelteKit but once it was approved for deployment, I re-wrote it in React for easier
                              integration with the developer platform.  One year later, the app was deployed and is
                              currently being tested.

                              microservice in Typescript.  The majority of these modifications were made in order to
                              reduce repetitive work on the development side and automate/simplify support-related
                              responsibilities.

                              and a winback flow that used a "Sleep Quiz" to recommend products to customers based on their
                              sleep preferences.  My tech stack was limited since the site used Shopify but I was able to
                              do everything in Liquid (a templating framework similar to PHP) and Javascript.

While Battlegear 2 is open source, I had to decompile the Lord of the Rings mod to reference it in my code.  Due to distribution guidelines, I am not able to share the modpack that combines all the mods but players can use this mod in conjunction with the two mods mentioned to get the full effect.</p>
